Snapchat Pixel for WooCommerce

== Unlock Snapchat’s Powerful Tools for E-Commerce Businesses With the Snap Pixel ==

Get Snapchat Pixel for WooCommerce to track conversions, build retargeting audiences, and optimize campaigns towards results that matter most to your business.

Advertising on Snapchat helps you reach untapped audiences, find new customers, and increase your online sales. With this extension, you can add the Snap Pixel to your site in just a few clicks.

With Snapchat Pixel for WooCommerce, you can:
- Utilize our built-in Snap Pixel events to track when Snapchatters take meaningful actions on your website, such as view products, add items to their carts, and make a purchase.
- Create Custom Pixel Audiences to target high-intent audiences, like Snapchatters who recently visited your product pages. 
- Access powerful tools for e-commerce that help you optimize campaigns to drive purchases, such as personalized, automated ad creation with Dynamic Ads.

Here’s how this extension helps you reach high-intent audiences and grow your business.

= Measure the Impact of your Ad Campaigns = 

The Snap Pixel is a piece of JavaScript code that reliably sends key customer events from your store to Snapchat, and measures the impact of your campaigns across devices, so you can see how many Snapchatters take action on your website after seeing your ads. You can measure these goals beyond what happens during a single session, or on a single device.

Once you have the Snap Pixel set up, you can view reporting in Snapchat Ads Manager to understand conversions, sales, and revenue attributed to your ads.

= Create Pixel Custom Audiences and Re-Engage Snapchatters =

With the Snap Pixel, advertisers are able to reach a global audience and become a part of their everyday conversations through advanced audience targeting capabilities. 

**Pixel Custom Audiences** allow you to reach a group of high-intent individuals who have engaged directly with your brand in the past. You can also retarget Snapchatters that have already taken an action on your website and create **Lookalike Audiences** to reach Snapchatters with similar characteristics to your existing customers.

= Automate Ad Creation with Dynamic Ads =
Snapchat makes it simple to create compelling ads that drive online sales. For example, by leveraging catalogs and the Snap Pixel, **Dynamic Ads** allows you to create an engaging, personalized shopping experience on Snapchat. 

Dynamic Ads help you reach potential customers and retarget existing customers, showing Snapchatters personalized ads, built directly from your product catalog. These ads are tailored to Snapchatters based on their engagement with your brand. 

= Why Snapchat Ads? =
People use Snapchat to communicate with friends, build relationships, play and learn. You can inspire action with full-screen, digital ads that boost awareness, drive conversions, and generate real results for your business. 

Snapchatters are a unique, valuable audience that can't be reached anywhere else. With Snapchat Ads, you can:
**Reach a highly engaged audience**
- On average, 238 million use Snapchat every day¹
- Our community spends an average of over 30 minutes on Snapchat every day²
- Today, each Daily Active User opens Snapchat 30 times per day on average²

**Capture spending power of Millennial & Gen Z audiences**
- In the U.S., UK, France, Canada, and Australia, Snapchat reaches more 13-24 year-olds than either Facebook or Instagram³
- Millennials and Gen Z have $1 trillion in direct spending power⁴

Snapchat offers a variety of tools built for [e-commerce businesses](https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/advertising/industry/ecommerce), like the Snap Pixel, to help you reach and convert this valuable audience.
